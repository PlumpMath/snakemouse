# Snake and Mouse

Snake-like game for GitHub Game Off 2017

## What's the game?

It's snake, but instead of the snake following your keystrokes it follows a mouse!

## How do I play?

You are the mouse. Since you're a mouse and have a little understanding of the workings of snakes, you are trying to get the snake to eat so much it dies of overlengthification. To do this you lead it to all of the nearby food, while making sure it doesn't eat you. Even though it would be most beneficial for you to get the snake to eat it's own tail, your score is based off your perception of success, which is how much the snake eats.

## How do I install?

Run the source with [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) or download a release and run the executable.
